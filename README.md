# pandas-challenge
In this assignment, we were given data from different schools (public and charter) for high school graders across the pyCity school district. Panda data frames were used to analyze school/student data.

Pandas-challenge is the main directory which contains the following project files/sub-directories:
	
		"PyCitySchools" sub-directory contains following files:
			- PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb (Jupiter notebook file which contains the actual code)
			- PyCity Schools Data Analysis.docs (Doc file which contains a written report of the data analyzed) 
		"Resources" sub- directory contains following input/data files:
			- schools_complete.csv
			- students_complete.csv
